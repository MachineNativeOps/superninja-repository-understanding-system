## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. AI-Driven Integration Analyzer

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/ai-integration-analyzer.yml`

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ Automated code change analysis
- ✅ Risk assessment based on file types and complexity
- ✅ FHS integration impact detection
- ✅ Intelligent recommendations generation
- ✅ Automated PR comments with AI analysis
- ✅ Smart label assignment for merge decisions

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Pull requests (opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled)
- Push to main/develop branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

### 2. Risk Assessment Algorithm

```python
# Risk Classification Logic
if python_files > 10 or fhs_files > 5:
    risk_level = "high"
elif python_files > 5 or fhs_files > 2:
    risk_level = "medium"
else:
    risk_level = "low"
```

**Decision Matrix**:
- **Low Risk**: Automatic approval and merge
- **Medium Risk**: Requires review, then auto-merge
- **High Risk**: Manual review required, no auto-merge

### 3. Automated Merge Safety Features

**Pre-Merge Checks**:
- ✅ All CI checks must pass
- ✅ Risk level must be low
- ✅ Must have "auto-merge-ready" label
- ✅ Must not have "do-not-merge" label
- ✅ Approval from AI review system

**Merge Method**: Squash merge for clean history

## 🛠️ Issue Resolution

### JavaScript Syntax Error - **RESOLVED**

**Problem**: JavaScript code in workflow file had syntax error in catch block structure

**Timeline**:
1. **Identified**: Workflow run #21090831366 failed
2. **Analyzed**: Found malformed JavaScript in PR comment creation
3. **Fixed**: Commit 30e28a1f corrected the syntax
4. **Verified**: Fix validated and deployed

**Fix Details**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
} catch (error) {
  comment += '無法讀取AI分析報告\n';
  repo: context.repo.repo,  // ❌ Incorrect
  body: comment              // ❌ Incorrect
});

// AFTER (Fixed)
} catch (error) {
  comment += '無法讀取AI分析報告\n';
}

github.rest.issues.createComment({
  issue_number: context.issue.number,
  owner: context.repo.owner,
  repo: context.repo.repo,
  body: comment
});
```
