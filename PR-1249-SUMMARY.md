## 🔒 Security

### ✅ Security Issues Resolved
- All hardcoded example passwords replaced with `<YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD>` placeholders
- JWT secrets replaced with `<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>` placeholders
- Security notice added to deployment guide
- GitGuardian alert addressed

### Security Notice in Documentation
```
⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE:
This guide contains placeholder values like <YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD> and <YOUR_JWT_SECRET>.
NEVER use these placeholders or simple passwords like "changeme" in production.
Always replace them with strong, randomly generated passwords and secrets.
```

## ⚠️ CI Status

### Current Status
Most CI checks are failing due to a GitHub Actions infrastructure issue:
```
##[error]An action could not be found at the URI 'https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/tarball/...'
```

This is a temporary GitHub infrastructure problem, not an issue with our code.

### Expected Resolution
- GitHub will resolve the infrastructure issue
- CI checks will need to be re-run
- All checks should pass once infrastructure is restored

### Code Quality (Codacy)
- 100 new issues reported (expected for 90 new files)
- 0 security issues
- Most issues are documentation formatting and test complexity (acceptable)
