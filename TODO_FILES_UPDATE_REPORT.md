## Conclusion

All TODO files have been updated to accurately reflect:
1. ✅ What was completed in the feature branch and integrated
2. ❌ What is future development work not part of this PR
3. 📋 Clear separation between "done" and "planned"

The integration is **100% complete** for all items that were part of the `feature/add-repository-structure` branch. The unchecked items in TODO files are documented future work for subsequent PRs.
